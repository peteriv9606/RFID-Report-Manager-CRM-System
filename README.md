# C# RFID Report Manager (CRM System)
My C# CRM System project, made on C# using Visual Studio.
The project consists of Windows forms, and a simple database, which allows the user or administrator to make end-of-the month reports for employees and using those reports to create monthly payment receipts, helping the company by removing the need of paperwork.
Generated reports can be sent to employees in the end of the month to help them know their monthly worked hours, and the amount of money that they are going to receive.

Project can be extended by adding more features, but for the course of work - current features enough.

You can use the setup file to setup the app to your local PC.
If you do not have MS Access installed on your PC, a folder named "Redistributables" contains OleDB Redistributables needed to run the program in order to connect with the database, and is located in the installation path.

After install, you can use these login credentials:
Username: MasterAdmin
Password: MasterAdmin
